  <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
  <p>I love music and I sometimes like to rap as well. I usually try to memorize the lyrics of many rap songs that I love. Some of these songs include Dreams and Nightmares by Meek Mill and Kung Fu by YBN Cordae. 
  <h2>My Heritage</h2>
  <p>I am a full blooded Nigerian, and I take a lot of pride with that. Both of my parents were immigrants from Nigeria and teach me more and more about the culture over there. I've been to Nigeria many times and I enjoy going there everytime.</p>
  <h2>The Sports I Play</h2>
  <p>I've played baseball all my life and I enjoyed it for many years. As soon as high school came around, I played freshman football to try it out cause I liked it. I ended up enjoying it and it has made me into what I am today. I also pplay track and rugby as extracurricular sports for recruiting.</p>
